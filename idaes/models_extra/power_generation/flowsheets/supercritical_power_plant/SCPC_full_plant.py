This is an example supercritical pulverized coal (SCPC) power plant, including
steam cycle and boiler heat exchanger network model.

This simulation model consist of a ~595 MW gross coal fired power plant.
The dimensions and operating conditions used for this simulation do not
represent any specific coal-fired power plant.

This model is for demonstration and tutorial purposes only.
Before looking at the model, it may be useful to look
at the process flow diagram (PFD).

SCPC Power Plant

Inputs:
    Fresh Water (water make up)
    Throttle valve opening,
    BFW - boiler feed water (from Feed water heaters)
    Coal from pulverizers

Main Assumptions:
    Coal flowrate as a function of load, coal HHV is fixed and heat dutty
    splitt from fire side to water wall and platen superheater is fixed.

    Boiler heat exchanger network:
        Water Flow:
            Fresh water -> FWH's -> Economizer -> Water Wall -> Primary SH -> Platen SH
              -> Finishing Superheate -> HP Turbine -> Reheater -> IP Turbine
        Flue Gas Flow:
            Fire Ball -> Platen SH -> Finishing SH -> Reheater  -> o -> Economizer 
            -> Air Preheater                        -> Primary SH --^
        Steam Flow:
            Boiler -> HP Turbine -> Reheater -> IP Turbine
            HP, IP, and LP steam extractions to Feed Water Heaters


    Models used:
        - Mixers: Attemperator, Flue gas mix
        - Heater: Platen SH, Fire/Water side (simplified model),
                  Feed Water Heaters, Hot Tank, Condenser
        - BoilerHeatExchanger: Economizer, Primary SH, Finishing SH, Reheater
            + Shell and tube heat exchanger
                - tube side: Steam (side 1 holdup)
                - shell side: flue gas (side 2 holdup)
        - Steam Turbines
        - Pumps

    This function builds the supercritical power plant model, including the steam cycle 
    and boiler heat exchanger network.

    Logic:
    1. Build the steam cycle flowsheet using the setup_steam_cycle function.
        See: idaes/models_extra/power_generation/flowsheets/supercritical_steam_cycle.py
                for more details
    2. Build the boiler heat exchanger network flowsheet using the build_boiler function.
        See: idaes/models_extra/power_generation/flowsheets/supercritical_power_plant/
                boiler_subflowsheet_build.py for more details
        This step involves appending the boiler unit models into the steam cycle model, 
        resulting in a single model object containing both flowsheets.

        
    Notes
    -----
    1. The initialized model may be saved to ``SCPC_full.json`` using
    ``MS.to_json()`` and restored in a later run using ``MS.from_json()``.

    2. If the connected model produces an infeasible solution, the high-pressure
    turbine connection can be tested by deactivating the enthalpy and pressure
    equalities on ``m.fs.Att2HP_expanded`` and fixing the corresponding inlet
    conditions on ``m.fs.turb.inlet_split.inlet``. The fixed values should be
    checked against the outlet conditions from ``m.fs.ATMP1``.

    3. To maintain the high-pressure turbine inlet temperature at approximately
    866 K, fix the attemperator outlet molar enthalpy and unfix the platen
    superheater heat duty. Using enthalpy to control temperature is valid here
    only when the corresponding pressure is also fixed.
